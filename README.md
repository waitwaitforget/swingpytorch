The objective of this repository is to create a more user-friendly framework for researchers or student who just begin to learn deep learning.
There are many existing similar respositories on github, what's the features of swingpytorch?
- Efficient 
- General and easy-customized

# Getting Started to train any deep learning models
## Data preparation
Take image classification for example, suppose you are going to train a classifier on you own image dataset.
There're several steps you need to follow.
- download (place) your data to a specific folder
- split train/val/test dataset
